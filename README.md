DateDecoder
===========

DateDecoder is a tool that helps you decode or verify dates that forensics tools returned.

This tool was developed when i have too many date/time to decode during work and CTF.
This is developed entirely out of fun and for practising my C# development. :D

Hope that it's useful to some people out there.
